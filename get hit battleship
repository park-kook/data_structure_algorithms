You're playing Battleship on a grid of cells with 

R rows and C columns. There are 0 or more battleships on the grid, each occupying a single distinct cell. 
The cell in the ith row from the top and jth column from the left either contains a battleship (
Gi,j=1

Gi,j=1) or doesn't (Gi,j=0).
You're going to fire a single shot at a random cell in the grid. You'll choose this cell uniformly at random 
from the Râˆ—C
 possible cells. You're interested in the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a battleship.
Your task is to implement the function getHitProbability(R, C, G) which returns this probability.
